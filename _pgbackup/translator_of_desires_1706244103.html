        <h6 style="font-family: 'Aboreto', cursive; margin: 5%;">Poems on love: an analysis</h6> 
        <div style="margin-left: 6%; margin-right: 10%;"> 
            <p>The following are some poems on love from <i>The Translator of Desires</i> translated by Michael Sells, along with my interpretations and analysis.</p>
            <hr style="margin-right: 2%"> 
            <p style="font-family: 'Amiri', serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 25px 45px 35px; line-height: 2; text-indent: 22px;"><i><p style="margin-left: 20px;">She smiled, lightning</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">flashed, and I couldn't</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">tell what it was</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">that split the night</p></i><br>
            <p><b>"She smiled:"</b> The use of the smile as an indicator of love seems a risky choice. There are
many possible states or events that can induce a smile--as a sign of love or deeply felt emotions
for another person, it seems to me a very weak indicator. The smile is too ubiquitous, too prone
to overvaluation. As a way of visualizing the metaphors which follow this phrase, it is, however,
rather appropriate: The smile is transitory--it comes on unbidden, without effort, and
disappears just as readily.</p>
            <p><b>"Lightning flashed:"</b> The analog of lightning for the beloved's smile suggests an
instantaneous change in the lover's mindset rather than a gradually evolving romantic
infatuation. It is a very appealing image, offering the potential for a radical change of state that
might alter one's life course dramatically in a matter of seconds. It also suggests transience, a
bright flash illuminating the sky for only a brief moment before returning the lover into a state
of darkness. This might perhaps be akin to the fickleness of the beloved's attitude toward the
lover, the attraction she feels being only momentary, to be replaced just as quickly with dislike
or indifference. In this case, the lightning is a fire that produces light but no warmth. It might
provide some insight to the lover or break him out of an emotional stupor, but it may not
necessarily portend what he thinks it does. This transience can also said to be in line with the
idea of a continual renewal of the image and the impossibility of its possession (Sells xxvii).<p><b>"I couldn't tell:"</b> This concerns the notion of uncertainty inherent to love--uncertainty as to
where one stands with the beloved, uncertainty about the emotions stirring within the lover's
and the beloved's hearts, uncertainty about who one is or would or could be if he were to merge
with the beloved. Here, the lover is uncertain about the particular quality in the beloved's smile
that gives it its transformative power. The intention behind the smile appears to be hidden from
the lover, though its effect on him is very much in full view. I find parallels here with the
"Bewildered" poem where the lover is similarly in a state of uncertainty.</p><p><b>"That split the night:"</b> The night here is a metaphor for the lover's spiritual or emotional
barrenness. It recalled for me the notion of the "dark night of the soul" from Christian
mysticism, the idea of a spiritual crisis or difficult period in one's life that must be overcome.
Stripped of its religious overtones, love here stands in as the purifying or clarifying force that
will set the lover's soul at ease and provide a path forward. The verb "split" here, as with the
verb "flashed" which preceded it, suggests this is to be an instantaneous process rather than
gradual, a sudden casting off of old modes of thinking, a tear in the fabric of the existential
dilemma that plagues the lover. This would perhaps represent the death of the ego, or <i>fana</i> as
Sells describes it in the introduction (xxvii).</p><hr style="margin-right: 2%"><i><br><p style="margin-left: 20px;">I live on and</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">in living die</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Farewell to her, then,</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">and to patience, farewell</p></i><br><p><b>"I live on:"</b> It is difficult to say what the lover's meaning is in this line. He appears conflicted
about the fact that he has endured the loss of his beloved. He lives on--is it a statement of fact,
of regret? The following line suggests the latter, but it might also be read as a sign of great
resilience.</p><p><b>"In living die:"</b> The pairing of antonyms here ("live" and "die") is intentional and meant to
convey that life is both physically and metaphorically a process of death. Physical in the sense
that all human bodies from the moment of birth are in a state of continual decay which has its
endpoint fixed at a certain hour on a certain day in a certain season. Metaphorical in the sense
that for some, the process of living, and dealing with the indignities and pains that life brings
with it, is its own form of death. I am reminded here of Hamlet's well-known soliloquy:</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">To die, to sleep</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">No more; and by a sleep, to say we end</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">That Flesh is heir to?</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">...</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">The Oppressor's wrong, the proud man's Contumely,</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>The pangs of dispriz'd Love</b>, the Law’s delay,</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">The insolence of Office, and the spurns</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">When he himself might his Quietus make</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">With a bare Bodkin?</p><p><b>"Farewell to her, then:"</b> This conveys that the lover no longer has access to the beloved, but
the way it is delivered suggests a sort of defiance on the part of the lover. He cannot have her, so
farewell, sent on her way with a rude gesture by which the lover hopes to cauterize his wounds.
It is noteworthy in its apparent simplicity: Farewell! I wash my hands of thee. That is all. But
the reader knows that is not all. The beloved will return in images to haunt him. The expression
is traditionally used for an amicable parting ("I hope that you fare well"), but it is not likely that
the lover's parting was either amicable or willed, nor that her rejection of him has not spawned a
great deal of animosity.</p><p><b>"To patience, farewell:"</b> To love is to become awash in time. The pleasure the beloved
brings does away with notions of time. The loved man is too concerned with securing and
enjoying his possession, too immersed in the gentleness of her embrace, to allow restlessness
any room within his soul. With her loss, so the loss of patience. But the line here suggests more
than this: It is also a hardening of the lover's soul, a statement of future unwillingness to invest
himself in another again only to endure further heartbreak.</p>
