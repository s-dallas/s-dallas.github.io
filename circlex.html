                    <p class="d-inline">There now came into view the indistinct shape of some grand structure, greater
                        in extent than even
                        the largest of mountains back in the realm of the living. As we descended, this monumental
                        edifice
                        began to take on the texture of a large beehive or wicker basket of some sort, and from it
                        emanated
                        a faint but steady drone which played more loudly upon our ears the nearer we approached. “After
                        such frightful visions, what could this earthen heap portend?” I asked my guide. “What souls
                        dwell
                        within this great gray hollow? It is the hum of some great activity, but listen—it repeats
                        itself.”</p>

                    <p class="d-inline">At this, my guide turned to me and, grasping my cloak at both ends, did wrap it
                        about my body. “Take
                        care to cover yourself before we enter,” he instructed me. “The souls you shall see here are
                        keen of
                        vision. They see everything and nothing. If you are not mindful, they will entangle you in their
                        proddings until your soul become the stuff of these great walls we now breach.” I did as he bade
                        me,
                        wrapping myself tightly, as though a pupa in its cocoon, which was quite befitting for this
                        great
                        nest we now encroached upon.</p>

                    <p class="d-inline">So great was the extent of the interior that we walked for some time, many hours
                        it did seem, before
                        encountering any distinct feature of its structure. The buzz of activity was that of a great
                        chorus,
                        perfectly synchronized. It would proceed for some time in a sequence of pitches, stop briefly,
                        and
                        then play itself again in the selfsame sequence and for the same duration, which I counted out
                        in my
                        footsteps.</p>

                    <p class="d-inline">After much time walking without encountering a single soul, I turned to my
                        guide: “O great poet,
                        what is this strange music we keep step to? Where are the souls to be found in these depths? I
                        feel
                        the presence of some force which guides us upon a fixed track, but none is to be seen.” At this,
                        he
                        motioned toward one of the walls which had now come into view. “See for yourself the ones who
                        have
                        built this great dome,” he said in reply.</p>

                    <p class="d-inline">As I drew nearer to the wall, what I saw both astonished and frightened me. The
                        wall, which I had
                        thought to be made of some straw or other earthen fare, was in fact a great mass of individual
                        receptacles, hexagonal in shape. Within each of these was a soul so misshapen, so unnatural that
                        I
                        could not at first recognize it as such. Each had a hunched form, knotted, roped, sprawled about
                        in
                        all directions but with a trajectory that was always parabolic and convex, always pointed
                        downward.
                        Fixed within this melted tangle of flesh were two large eyes, unblinking, alert, watchful,
                        studious
                        from the front, bandaged and bleeding from the back.</p>

                    <p class="d-inline">From one side of the receptacle, the soul would gaze at some object, slowly
                        extending two long
                        fingers from its deformed mass, prodding and patching at the wall with great confidence and
                        precision, before moving on to another part of the cell, where the strange ritual was repeated.
                        Perhaps inspired by the tenor of those great white eyes, the hypnotic droning that echoed inside
                        this capacious hive, I felt myself obliged to take a closer look. To my surprise, the walls of
                        these
                        receptacles were made of no actual substance that I could discern but rather a series of numbers
                        and
                        geometrical shapes of varying sizes and forms. What deception! From a great distance, what
                        seemed a
                        grand palace built by some ancient tribe was indeed millions upon millions of numerals and
                        abstract
                        symbols being manipulated by these watchful souls.</p>

                    <p class="d-inline">I had begun to address one of them when my guide interrupted: “I do not think it
                        will be fruitful to
                        tarry in this place for very long. These are souls who in life devoted themselves to what we
                        call
                        the sciences. They prided themselves on their rationality and so regimented their lives in
                        pursuit
                        of perfect order and ultimate knowledge of the universe. Chemists, engineers, mathematicians,
                        geometers, astronomers, biologists. They built great structures, discovered new instruments, saw
                        what their fellows could not, and concerned themselves not with the people or affairs of their
                        time.
                        They scoffed at the notion of the spirit, demonstrating with their works what they took to be
                        the
                        perfect, rational, machine-like provenance of the world. For their hubris, the souls which they
                        hid
                        from their own eyes in life have been boiled down, rearranged, recalculated, and reconfigured
                        much
                        as the matter they manipulated in that other place, until they do take the form which you now
                        see
                        before you.”</p>

                    <p class="d-inline">This I could not believe. All these great minds, studious and so careful in
                        conduct while living,
                        condemned to this perpetual mechanical toil. How could it be so? My guide led me on to a part of
                        the
                        nest where some of the larger receptacles were located. In one did I see what seemed a round
                        sphere
                        of wizened flesh, wiry white hair protruding from it in all directions. This ball would begin in
                        a
                        stationary position at the top of its cell and then fall in a pattern which I recognized from my
                        books as a schoolboy to be due to the gravitational forces which govern the other place, before
                        coming to an abrupt stop, exploding in a bright flash, and then reconstituting itself to begin
                        its
                        fall anew.</p>

                    <p class="d-inline">“The one you see before you was known as Einstein while living, whose
                        investigations of energy and
                        blind urgings in its use for the construction of weapons led to the incineration of hundreds of
                        thousands of innocent souls,” my guide explained. So confounded by this, so contrary to all I
                        had
                        been taught about this great man, that I began to look about me for some reassurance that those
                        who
                        made knowledge their sole pursuit in life could not possibly end up in such a place.</p>

                    <p class="d-inline">As I tried to regain my bearings, the droning which had by this point so taken
                        over our natural
                        rhythms as to become unnoticed now shifted to a high-pitched tone. It was here that I realized
                        this
                        new mechanical cacophony was coming from one of the souls in a neighboring receptacle, who it
                        seemed
                        did wish to speak to me.</p>

                    <p class="d-inline">So tangled up in letters and symbols was this soul, I could not make out where
                        to address him, but
                        as I made an effort to do so, my guide once more interjected. “This one which beeps at you, do
                        not
                        pay him any heed, lest you be torn between aughts and naughts. This was Turing, the father of
                        the
                        modern computer system, a man who paid more care to ones and zeros than to the salvation of his
                        own
                        soul. His great focus and precision in thought changed the way men see themselves, giving them a
                        machine which would put all manner of vice and evil before their eyes, turning them inward into
                        themselves and away from the regard of their fellows. His tinkering allowed rumor and hearsay to
                        spread faster than he whom the Greeks call Hermes could run, creating great misery and sorrow
                        for
                        many. For this, he is now condemned here to forever tangle and untangle himself in a mass of the
                        coded language which so preoccupied him and those who came after him in life.”</p>

                    <p class="d-inline">O, what treachery was this. That great invention, the computer, that we had so
                        believed to be the
                        beginning of a new and great era—how could it be known the path you led to was here? Rather than
                        to
                        have my thoughts forever flipped in this fashion, I wished to leave this place, but my guide
                        wished
                        to show me one more of the wretched souls in this den of tedium.</p>

                    <p class="d-inline">>As we made our way toward her receptacle, there was a sudden loud caw. At once,
                        the southern wall of
                        the hive was ripped away by the beak of a large crow, on whose head were a collection of souls,
                        disheveled but lively, all completely nude, some dancing strange dances, others connected in
                        frenzied coitus, some twitching about wounded limbs that were covered in leeches, others
                        speaking in
                        tongues with stakes of fire in their throats. Such was the energy of this collection of souls
                        that
                        the crow’s head began to sink in from the weight of all the activity. On the right wing of the
                        crow
                        were thousands of child souls, whose flesh was scorched and with tumorous growths in many
                        places. On
                        the left wing, some of the souls from the seventh circle who had taken their own lives, wailing
                        recriminations against themselves.</p>

                    <p class="d-inline">The sudden rupture into this ordered space of the giant bird and these foreign
                        souls set me and my
                        guide upon our backsides, from which recumbent positions we looked at the breach in the wall.
                        All
                        along the edges, and dangling from the tip of that great curvaceous beak, the souls of those
                        studious men did not stir an ounce. They fixed the white of their eyes upon their repetitious
                        tasks,
                        bodies always bent in a downward curve, keeping the bandaged backsides to the commotion going on
                        all
                        about them. So strange was this juxtaposition, of the haphazard and routine, the living and
                        dead, it
                        did seem to me that we had left the dark place and entered into a strange land. My guide,
                        however,
                        accustomed to such fare, picked himself up and, brushing the dust from his robes, helped me to
                        my
                        feet, whence we proceeded through the breach, the drone of those learned souls following after
                        us.</p>
