                <p>The relationship between Elizabeth Bennett and her mother might be characterized as a reversal
                    of the roles of parent and child. Both women are portrayed as headstrong and incapable of
                    persuasion by the other, but their temperaments, aims, and understanding of the nuances of
                    the social world they inhabit are completely at odds. By all accounts, Mrs. Bennet is a woman
                    of limited experience and tact. She is single-minded in her purpose: Seeing to it that all
                    of her daughters are married off to well-endowed men, regardless of the characters of those men.
                </p>
                <p>Elizabeth, by contrast, is quite independent in her thought, more refined in her bearing and
                    far more circumpsect than her mother about the impression she is making on others. Throughout
                    the novel, she sees her mother as a great source of shame and embarassment, hindering her attempts
                    at heading off the antagonisms of the Bingley sisters, who take delight in the crude nature of
                    her kin, and ingratiating herself with Darcy.
                </p>
                <p>There is a great tension between what Mrs. Bennett desires for her daughter and what Elizabeth
                    herself desires, and the two are irreconciably at odds with one another on this point. The sense
                    that one gets of the relationship between the two is that it is Mrs. Bennett who is the child,
                    sulking in petulance when things do not go as she intends, speaking whatever crudity may
                    come through her head at the present moment regardless of who hears it, running to her husband
                    to try and get her way. Elizabeth, when she is not seething at her mother's indelicacies around
                    good company, treats her as both a vexation and simultaneously as a source of amusement. Her
                    mother in many respects behaves as though she were an overgrown infant and her daughter has taken
                    on the role of the sensible adult in the room.
                </p>
                <p>While this tension is not the focus of the novel and ultimately does not irreparable tarnish
                    the relationship, it gives the reader the sense early on that Elizabeth has been tethered
                    unwillingly to
                    someone obstinant, whom no amount of earnest entreaty or other tactic can persuade, and who,
                    if left unchecked, will spoil her chances at living a meaningful life. Mrs. Bennett seeks to
                    mold Elizabeth in the only mold she knows, as she has done with her younger daughters, who have
                    dutifully carried on the legacy of her frivolity. There is an underlying antagonism between
                    mother and daughter that, if not resolved, has potentially grave outcomes for one or the other.

                The first evidence of Mrs. Bennet's lack of social graces comes early on in a discussion about town
                and country. There is a tacic understanding among all present that Mrs. Bennet's offense taken
                at Mr. Darcy's comment about the country offering limited opportunities for character study is more
                about her own pride as a country dweller with a limited experience of city life. Elizabeth longs
                for her mother to keep such opinions to herself, feeling she is “exposing" the family to the ridicule
                of their social superiors.

                            know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers
                            a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
                            always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
                            temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to
                            her. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming pros-
                            pect over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is
                            equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry
                            I hope, though you have but a short lease.’</div>
                        <div class="book-p">‘Whatever I do is done in a hurry,’ replied he; ‘and therefore if
                            I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
                            minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.’</div>
                        <div class="book-p">‘That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,’ said Elizabeth.</div>
                        <div class="book-p">‘You begin to comprehend me, do you?’ cried he, turning towards her.
                            <div class="book-p">‘Oh! yes — I understand you perfectly.’</div>
                            <div class="book-p">‘I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
                                through I am afraid is pitiful.’</div>
                            <div class="book-p">‘That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
                                intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.’</div>
                            ‘Lizzy,’ cried her mother, ‘remember where you are, and do not
                            run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.’

                        <div class="book-p">‘I did not know before,’ continued Bingley immediately, ‘that you
                            were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.’</div>
                        <div class="book-p">‘Yes; but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at
                            least that advantage.’</div>

                            for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very con-
                            fined and unvarying society.’</div>
                        <div class="book-p">‘But people themselves alter so much,* that there is something new
                            to be observed in them for ever.’</div>
                        <div class="book-p"><mark>‘Yes, indeed,’ cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning
                                a country neighbourhood. ‘I assure you there is quite as much
                                of that going on in the country as in town.’</mark></div>
                        <div class="book-p"><mark>Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for
                                a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had
                                gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.</mark></div>

                                She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short
                                silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his
                                kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr.
                                Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger
                                sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She per-
                                formed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet
                                was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this sig-
                                nal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls
                                had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result
                                of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having prom-
                                ised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.
                                Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
                                and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
                                affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high ani-
                                mal spirits,* and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the atten-
                                tions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her own
                                easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She
                                was very equal therefore to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the
                                ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would
                                be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His
                                answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother’s ear.</div>

                                she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,

                                silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
                                complaisance, — but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such

                                song. Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations;
                                and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an

                        The troublesome relationship between mother and daughter is not one-sided. In one telling

                        maternal bond between her and Elizabeth, which may perhaps surprise the reader. Though
                        Elizabeth has a sense of shame about her mother, there is never any true mention of dislike
                        or lack of feeling for her.

                                    and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how
                                    happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at

                                    he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.</div>

                            There
                            is no undestanding on Mrs. Bennet's part of her daughter's autonomy as an individual.
                            This is at
                            the core of the conflict between Elizabeth and her mother. If Elizabeth does something
                            that
                            runs counter to the aims or beliefs of her mother, it is because she is lacking in
                            reason and must
                            be managed accordingly to fit her mother's will. It is as though Mrs. Bennet sees her
                            daughter as
                            little more than a piece of property, an extension of her rather than her own person
                            with her own
                            desires, wishes, and feelings. This is illustrated after Elizabeth rejects the marriage
                            proposal of Mr. Collins.<br><br>
                            There is, nevertheless, a steadfast refusal by Elizabeth to be treated as such. She
                            looks at her mother's
                            protestations first with an earnest attempt at reason, then with humor, as though she
                            were dealing with
                            her own child rather than her mother.

                                <p>This tension between Elizabeth and her mother is pertinent in light of the theme of
                                    <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. The novel at its core is about the way we rely on our
                                    first impressions of
                                    others to form our opinions and guide our actions. Elizabeth's ability to make a
                                    favorable first impression,
                                    to show off her individual talents and personality, is constrained by her mother's
                                    claim to her
                                    as her progeny and as an instrument to be used in crafting her own image to present
                                    to the world, that of a successful
                                    mother whose daughters have all married well. This competition of wills highlights
                                    the absurdity of relying upon
                                    first impressions, as underneath the surface there are always contradictions and
                                    unexpected realities which
                                    complicate matters and force us to reconsider our initial impressions.
