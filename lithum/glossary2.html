            <div class="col-8 h3 bellefair-regular">
                <p>James' relationship to his father centers on the latter's cold and aloof manner. Mr. Ramsay
                    is, for all of his talents, not the most affectionate or attentive man when it comes to his
                    children. His academic work keeps him cloistered from the real world and its problems and
                    he largely leaves the childrearing to his wife. This in essence leaves James without a suitable
                    male
                    role
                    model, which manifests in his development of an attitude of disdain for his father and
                    a preference from a young age for the company of his mother, whose nuturance and tender care
                    for her son brings into sharp contrast the neglectful tendencies of his father. This outward
                    display of malice and ill-will towards his father mirrors what James thinks is his father's
                    indifference toward him, a sort of rebellion against the relinquishing of the paternal duties
                    on the part of Mr. Ramsay.</p>
                <p>What James feels toward his father internally is less hatred than a secret reverence
                    and a great disappointment at his father's lack of acknowledgement of his talents and
                    capabilities. Mr. Ramsay does not praise his children, indeed seems to have nothing to say
                    to them unless it is a form of of punishment or displeasure with some aspect of their behavior.
                    James recognizes this as a form of tyranny and urges his sister Cam to fight with him against
                    his father's silent domination of them.</p>
                <p>This tension between hatred and reverence, resignation and resistance is something James
                    struggles with greatly after his mother's passing and comes to its most fervent peak during
                    the family's boat trip to the Lighthouse near the end of the book. It is here where James
                    has the realization that he is not separate from his father but inextricably linked to him.
                    The two share an unspoken internal struggle of loneliness and disappointment and James
                    can no more distinguish himself from his father in the same
                    way that Mr. Ramsay, in a moment of great joy for James, comes to the same silent realization
                    and praises his son for the first time.</p>
                <p>James' relationship with his father, paticularly this breakthrough toward the end of the novel,
                    represents a struggle for identity, the tension between identifying oneself on the basis of
                    what one is not ("a tyrant") and following the mold of one's parents in the quest to build a
                    life of one's own.

            <div class="col-8 h3 im-fell-english-sc-regular paper-box mb-5 p-5" style="line-height: 1.5;">For some
                textual evidence of
                this analysis, as Mr. Ramsay
                sits reading on the boat to the Lighthouse, James observes him, the way he's aged, the physical
                manifestion of
                his loneliness, which James recognizes in himself as part of his own reality. In this way, the two
                are
                shown to
                share a bond-the loneiness of the academic who used his work as an escape, and the loneliness of the
                child who
                bore the consequences of that escape. <br><br>
                Both too, with the loss of Mrs. Ramsay, now share a new form of loneliness,
                for Mr. Ramsay the death of his wife, who not only managed the household affairs but constantly
                reassured her
                husband, for James the loss of his beloved mother who tried to shield him from the difficulties of
                the
                world
                through an outpouring of love and attention. There is a recognition for James here that these two,
                father and son,
                who were once so remote from one another actually have more in common than he previously
                assumed.<br><br>
                Likewise when James first sees the Lighthouse, he has a sense of wonder and elevation of spirit. He
                again looks at
                his father reading and knows at once that this same feeling instilled in him by the Lighthouse is
                one
                shared by his father.

                    <div class="book-p">Mr. Ramsay had almost done reading. One hand hovered over the page as if to
                        be
                        in readiness to turn it the very instant he had finished it. He sat there bareheaded with
                        the
                        wind blowing his hair about, extraordinarily exposed to everything. He looked very old.
                        <mark>He
                            looked, James thought, getting his head now against the Lighthouse, now against the
                            waste of
                            waters running away into the open, like some old stone lying on the sand; he looked as
                            if he
                            had become physically what was always at the back of both of their minds―<b>that
                                loneliness
                                which was for both of them the truth about things.</b></mark>
                    </div>

                    <div class="book-p">He was reading very quickly, as if he were eager to get to the end. Indeed
                        they
                        were very close to the Lighthouse now. There it loomed up, stark and straight, glaring white
                        and
                        black, and one could see the waves breaking in white splinters like smashed glass upon the
                        rocks. One could see lines and creases in the rocks. One could see the windows clearly; a
                        dab of
                        white on one of them, and a little tuft of green on the rock. A man had come out and looked
                        at
                        them through a glass and gone in again. <mark>So it was like that, James thought, the
                            Lighthouse
                            one had seen across the bay all these years; it was a stark tower on a bare rock. It
                            satisfied him. It confirmed some obscure feeling of his about his own character.</mark>
                        The
                        old ladies, he thought, thinking of the garden at home, went dragging their chairs about on
                        the
                        lawn. Old Mrs Beckwith, for example, was always saying how nice it was and how sweet it was
                        and
                        how they ought to be so proud and they ought to be so happy, but as a matter of fact, James
                        thought, looking at the Lighthouse stood there on its rock, it’s like that. <mark>He looked
                            at
                            his father reading fiercely with his legs curled tight. <b>They shared that
                                knowledge</b>.</mark> “We are driving before a gale―we must sink,” he began saying
                        to
                        himself, half aloud, exactly as his father said it.</div>

                    that
                    James' father has never praised him, a secret grievance James has been nursing and evidence,
                    along
                    with his silent admiration of his father as he reads his book on the boat, that he actually
                    holds
                    the man in great reverence and desires his approval.

                            of
                            your reach somewhere far away on some desolate stump. She gazed at the immense expanse
                            of
                            the sea. The island had grown so small that it scarcely looked like a leaf any longer.
                            It
                            looked like the top of a rock which some wave bigger than the rest would cover. Yet in
                            its
                            frailty were all those paths, those terraces, those bedrooms― all those innumberable
                            things.
                            But as, just before sleep, things simplify themselves so that only one of all the myriad
                            details has power to assert itself, so, she felt, looking drowsily at the island, all
                            those
                            paths and terraces and bedrooms were fading and disappearing, and nothing was left but a
                            pale blue censer swinging rhythmically this way and that across her mind. It was a
                            hanging
                            garden; it was a valley, full of birds, and flowers, and antelopes... She was falling
                            asleep.

                            <div class="book-p">"Come now,” said Mr Ramsay, suddenly shutting his book.</div>

                            <div class="book-p">Come where? To what extraordinary adventure? She woke with a start.
                                To
                                land somewhere, to climb somewhere? Where was he leading them? For after his immense
                                silence the words startled them. But it was absurd. He was hungry, he said. It was
                                time
                                for lunch. Besides, look, he said. “There’s the Lighthouse. We’re almost there.”
                            </div>

                            Mr Ramsay opened the parcel and shared out the sandwiches among them. Now he was happy,
                            eating bread and cheese with these fishermen. He would have liked to live in a cottage
                            and
                            lounge about in the harbour spitting with the other old men, James thought, watching him
                            slice his cheese into thin yellow sheets with his penknife.

                                drowned in a storm, but it is a perfectly straightforward affair, and the depths of

                                    Turning back among the many leaves which the past had folded in him, peering
                                    into
                                    the heart of that forest where light and shade so chequer each other that all

                                    is distorted, and one blunders, now with the sun in one’s eyes, now with a dark

                                    concrete shape. Suppose then that as a child sitting helpless in a perambulator,
                                    or
                                    on some one’s knee, he had seen a waggon crush ignorantly and innocently, some
                                    one’s
                                    foot? Suppose he had seen the foot first, in the grass, smooth, and whole; then
                                    the
                                    wheel; and the same foot, purple, crushed. But the wheel was innocent. So now,
                                    when
                                    his father came striding down the passage knocking them up early in the morning
                                    to

                                    foot. One sat and watched it.</div>

                                    flowers;
                                    a certain light; a few figures. Everything tended to set itself in a garden
                                    where
                                    there was none of this gloom. None of this throwing of hands about; people spoke
                                    in
                                    an ordinary tone of voice. They went in and out all day long. There was an old
                                    woman
                                    gossiping in the kitchen; and the blinds were sucked in and out by the breeze;

                                    was blowing, all was growing; and over all those plates and bowls and tall
                                    brandishing red and yellow flowers a very thin yellow veil would be drawn, like
                                    a
                                    vine leaf, at night. Things became stiller and darker at night. But the
                                    leaf-like
                                    veil was so fine, that lights lifted it, voices crinkled it; he could see
                                    through it
                                    a figure stooping, hear, coming close, going away, some dress rustling, some

                                <p>The motif here centers around the role of communication or rather the lack of
                                    communication between
                                    son and father. In the larger picture throughout the work, we get a sense of the
                                    internal monologues of many of the characters,
                                    but the ability to communicate their feelings, which often take on contradictory
                                    aspects, is troublesome. We get a glimpse of
                                    the love they share for one another at the conclusion of the dinner scene, but
                                    otherwise there appears to be a siloing of
                                    feelings. Mrs. Ramsay cannot tell her husband that she loves him. Mr. Ramsay can
                                    only hint at his need for reassurance,
                                    which his wife has noticed to pick up on. Lily's outlet for her feelings she tries
                                    and many times fails to communicate
                                    through her paintings. This moment of concluding praise of James by his father is
                                    one of genuine feeling expressed, of direct
                                    communication.

                                <p>As I came upon this episode with James and Mr. Ramsay, I was immediately reminded
                                    of
                                    a scene from the well-known film by Ingmar Bergman, <i>Through a Glass
                                        Darkly</i>.
                                    Though it has no bearing on Woolf's work or on this analysis, it merits
                                    mentioning
                                    for the similarity in the relationship difficulties between father and
                                    son we
                                    find in <i>To the Lighthhouse.</i></p>
                                <p>The plot centers around a young woman who is mentally ill and slowly losing her
                                    sanity. Her father is a man very much like Mr. Ramsay: A writer, a man of words,
                                    aloof from his children, immersed in his work, undergoing an existential crisis
                                    while his family falls apart around him.</p>
                                <p>The young woman's brother Minus, around the same age as James, is caught up in
                                    this
                                    turmoil
                                    and deeply wishes his father would talk to him and recognize his own talents as
                                    a
                                    writer. At the end of the film, there is a scene with a very similar motif as the
                                    one I've described abaove in <i>To
                                        the Lighthouse</i>.
                                    Minus' father finally speaks to him, acknowledges him as his son, and Minus
                                    echoes
                                    James
                                    in his joy ("Papa spoke to me!").</i>
