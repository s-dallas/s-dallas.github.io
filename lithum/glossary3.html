                <p>Milkman from an early age has a great deal of respect for his father, though he recognizes he is
                    very much unlike him, and his respect is mixed with fear. Macon Jr. is not a friendly man to those
                    outside of the family, and for his family he reserves a good deal of criticism. He is a domineering
                    man, filled with strength and vigor but also a great deal of
                    anger and disappointment. Milkman finds himself weak
                    by comparison. He has a leg-length discrepancy and cannot hope to ever emulate his father.
                    Though he works in his father's business, there is
                    no sense of shared identity or path forward for him.
                </p>
                <p>Milkman sees himself in figures who are in some way compromimsed or disadvantaged. From an early age,
                    he tries to differentiate himself from his father both in apperance and attitude. This is his
                    first attempt at separating himself from his father and trying to craft an identity that better
                    suits his
                    physicality and temperament. The company he chooses, Guitar and his aunt Pilate whom Macon Jr. has
                    forbidden him to see, is a sort of thumbing the nose at the father, an incipient form of rebellion.
                </p>
                <p>When Milkman enters young adulthood, this self-identification with weakness is replaced with a new
                    confidence
                    in his abilities. The striking of the father is an important turning
                    point for Milkman, as the roles of domineering father and obedient son are reversed. It is now
                    Milkman who
                    has triumphed over the father. This reversal is not without consequences. When he sees his father
                    bested
                    by him, it is a painful realization that the man he once reverenced for his strength, that idealized
                    form of
                    the masculine and invulernable father, is no longer something to be taken for granted.
                </p>
                <p>The sordid story told to Milkman by his father regarding his mother's past shatters Milkman's sense
                    of belonging or
                    having his own people. His identity in the making is compromised, and the need to leave his family
                    and build
                    a life of his own for himself becomes more urgent. The visit to his father's hometown in
                    Pennsylvania is something of
                    a reversal of these sentiments. He sees
                    his father for the first time through the eyes of people who knew him as a child and the love he had
                    for his own
                    murdered father. The way Macon Jr. is described by these older men instills a new sense of pride in
                    Milkman for
                    his father, who he was, and gives him some glimpse into Macon's past. There is no longer a clear
                    split between
                    son and father, and the sense for Macon that he is a completely separate entity from his father is
                    done away with.
                </p>
                <p>On Macon's part, the son is an escape from disappointment. His affection for Milkman appears to be
                    conditioned upon the sorry
                    state of his conjugal life - a sort of using the son as a means of ownership to spite the wife and
                    her history as the daughter
                    of a wealthy man. The whole basis for the paternal/filial relationship then has its origins not in
                    an unconditional love
                    but one based upon pre-exsting circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>The great strength of Milkman in the end is the realization that such relationships can never be
                    perfect, indeed should not
                    be expected to be perfect, because they are relations between people and people are inevitably
                    flawed. Milkman offers the
                    reader the idea that one's relations with one's parents are inevitably of little consequence in who
                    one becomes. There is
                    no dichotomy between the terrible and the good, separation vs reconcilation. One can be both
                    separate and connected
                    simultaneously if one is willing to accept situations for what they are but not attribute too much
                    importance to them.
                </p>

                The notions of the strong father and the weak son are spelled out fairly clearly in the text early on.
                The differences between
                the two are enumerated in a single paragraph as a collection of alternating descriptors. We learn that
                Milkman feels more of
                an attachment to historical figures like FDR, presumably from his suffering from polio, than he does to
                his father, even though it was his father who instilled this
                imagingation of the past into Milkman when he was very young.

                    <mark>Milkman secretly preferred FDR and felt very very close to him. <b>Closer, in fact, to him
                            than to his own father</b></mark>, for Macon had no imperfection and
                    age seemed to strengthen him. Milkman feared his father,
                    respected him, but knew, because of the leg, that he could
                    never emulate him. So he differed from him as much as he
                    dared. <mark>Macon was clean-shaven; Milkman was desperate
                        for a mustache. Macon wore bow ties; Milkman wore four-
                        in-hands. Macon didn’t part his hair; Milkman had a part
                        shaved into his. Macon hated tobacco; Milkman tried to put
                        a cigarette in his mouth every fifteen minutes. Macon
                        hoarded his money; Milkman gave his away.</mark> But he
                    couldn’t help sharing with Macon his love of good shoes
                    and fine thin socks. And he did try, as his father’s
                    employee, to do the work the way Macon wanted it done.
                    <div class="book-p">Macon was delighted. His son belonged to him now and
                        not to Ruth, and he was relieved at not having to walk all
                        over town like a peddler collecting rents. It made his
                        business more dignified, and he had time to think, to plan,
                        to visit the bank men, to read the public notices, auctions,
                        to find out what plots were going for taxes, unclaimed heirs’
                        property, where roads were being built, what supermarkets,
                        schools; and who was trying to sell what to the government
                        for the housing projects that were going to be built. The
                        quickie townlets that were springing up around war plants.
                        He knew as a Negro he wasn’t going to get a big slice of
                        the pie. But there were properties nobody wanted yet, or
                        little edges of property somebody didn’t want Jews to have,
                        or Catholics to have, or properties nobody knew were of
                        any value yet. There was quite a bit of pie filling oozing
                        around the edge of the crust in 1945. Filling that could be
                        his. Everything had improved for Macon Dead during the
                        war. Except Ruth. And years later when the war was over
                        and that pie filling had spilled over into his very lap, had
                        stickied his hands and weighed his stomach down into a
                        sagging paunch, he still wished he had strangled her back
                        in 1921. She hadn’t stopped spending occasional nights
                        out of the house, but she was fifty years old now and what
                        lover could she have kept so long? What lover

                    good sense of Macon Jr.'s
                    domineering personality, it is probably best to look at the way he thinks of himself in his own
                    words, at least as it relates to his role within
                    the family unit and as head of the household. In the scene where Milkman strikes his father, we get
                    both a revealing
                    look into Macon Jr.'s thoughts as well as his son's about what has just taken place and what it
                    means for them. Macon Jr.
                    is shocked at the challenge of his son and his inability to respond in kind. Milkman is likewise
                    shocked at his power but also
                    greatly saddened by what he has done, what he has thrown away about his previous understanding of
                    his father.

                                    plate becoming the fist he smashed into her jaw.</div>

                                    cover her lips as she searched with her tongue for any
                                    broken teeth, and discovering none, tried to adjust the
                                    partial plate in her mouth without anyone noticing—and that
                                    on that day he would not be able to stand it. Before his
                                    father could draw his hand back, Milkman had yanked him

                                responsibilities stretched out before him, but he was not
                                prepared to take advantage of the former, or accept the
                                burden of the latter. So he cock-walked around the table

                                really distinguish them (or their roles) from his mother. They
                                were in their early teens when he was born; they were thirty-
                                five and thirty-six now. But since Ruth was only sixteen
                                years older than Lena, all three had always looked the
                                same age to him. Now when he met his sisters’ eyes over
                                the table, they returned him a look of hatred so fresh, so
                                new, it startled him. Their pale eyes no longer appeared to
                                blur into their even paler skin. It seemed to him as though
                                charcoal lines had been drawn around their eyes; that two
                                drag lines had been smudged down their cheeks, and their
                                rosy lips were swollen in hatred so full it was about to burst
                                through. Milkman had to blink twice before their faces
                                returned to the vaguely alarmed blandness he was
                                accustomed to. Quickly he left the room, realizing there was
                                no one to thank him—or abuse him. His action was his
                                alone. It would change nothing between his parents. It would
                                change nothing inside them. He had knocked his father
                                down and perhaps there were some new positions on the
                                chessboard, but the game would go on.</div>

                        When Milkman visits the old men in the town in Pennsylvania, their memories of Macon Jr.
                        contradict his own notions of his father. Gone is the domineering, repressed man fixated
                        on business building, replaced with a cheerful young Macon Jr., strong, active, an inspiring
                        figure that Milkman cannot recognize. This fresh look at his father through the eyes of
                        these older men reinstill Milkman's sense of belonging, not to a sorrowful, angry, sordid
                        “people" but the son of a great man, whose life experiences may have changed him for the worse.
                        This new narrative in some sense supplants the old, or at least nudges it aside enough for
                        Milkman to reconsider his relationship with his father.

                                days at Reverend Cooper’s house as his guest, and the
                                purpose of long visits from every old man in the town who
                                remembered his father or his grandfather, and some who’d
                                only heard. They all repeated various aspects of the story,
                                all talked about how beautiful Lincoln’s Heaven was. Sitting
                                in the kitchen, they looked at Milkman with such rheumy
                                eyes, and spoke about his grandfather with such awe and
                                affection, Milkman began to miss him too. His own father’s
                                words came back to him: “I worked right alongside my
                                father. Right alongside him.” Milkman thought then that his
                                father was boasting of his manliness as a child. Now he
                                knew he had been saying something else. That he loved his
                                father; had an intimate relationship with him; that his father
                                loved him, trusted him, and found him worthy of working
                                “right alongside” him. “Something went wild in me,” he’d
                                said, “when I saw him on the ground.”</div>
                            <div class="book-p">His was the genuine feeling that Milkman had faked
                                when Reverend Cooper described the hopelessness of
                                “doing anything.” <mark>These men remembered both Macon

                                Only one of them remembered his grandmother. “Good-
                                lookin, but looked like a white woman. Indian, maybe. Black
                                hair and slanted-up eyes. Died in childbirth, you know.” The
                                more the old men talked—the more he heard about the only
                                farm in the county that grew peaches, real peaches like
                                they had in Georgia, the feasts they had when hunting was

                                something in his life. <mark>They talked about digging a well,

                        There is an overall sense that what one makes of oneself should not be an account of one's
                        relationship to one's parents. There is a parallel relationship at play in the novel not
                        just between Macon Jr. and Milkman, but Macon Jr. and his own father Macon Dead Sr. In
                        both respects, perhaps more so in Macon Sr. than Macon Jr., there was a notion that to
                        survive
                        in the world, one had to get one's hands dirty and put forth the effort, not dwell on the
                        minituae of one's relationship to one's father. Macon Dead Sr.'s
                        acquisition and
                        development of his farm was this achievement. For Macon Jr., it was his real estate
                        business.<br><br>
                        In one of the more exciting passages in the book, the old men in the town in
                        Pennsylvania
                        give a barrage of memory mixed with future, spurred on by Milkman's presence and encouragement.
                        Milkman begins a series of boasts about the man he not long ago had struck in anger, rekindling
                        his respect for his father that seemed to be lost for good.

                                        boys at the time. Macon Dead was the farmer they wanted
                                        to be, the clever irrigator, the peachtree grower, the hog

                                        He had come out of nowhere, as ignorant as a hammer and

                                        ten acres, the next ten more. Sixteen years later he had one
                                        of the best farms in Montour County. A farm that colored
                                        their lives like a paintbrush and spoke to them like a

                                two years (they laughed); and when he told them how his
                                father tried to buy the Erie Lackawanna (it sounded better
                                that way), they hooted with joy. That’s him! That’s Old
                                Macon Dead’s boy, all right! They wanted to know
                                everything and Milkman found himself rattling off assets like
                                an accountant, describing deals, total rents income, bank
                                loans, and this new thing his father was looking into—the
                                stock market.

                            Near the end of the book, Milkman is watching a group of children play. It not only
                            elicits
                            memories of his own childhood but puts him into something of a trance, giving him
                            clarity of thought.
                            He recognizes his love for his family. He sees the flaws in his father and now
                            understands why he became
                            the man he is. He acknowledges the futility in wasting his time hating them. It's a
                            moment of growth for Milkman,
                            a moment of clarity and maturity.

                                one he had heard off and on all his life. That old blues song
                                Pilate sang all the time: “O Sugarman don’t leave me here,”
                                except the children sang, “Solomon don’t leave me here.”
                                <div class="book-p">Milkman smiled, remembering Pilate. Hundreds of miles
                                    away, he was homesick for her, for her house, for the very
                                    people he had been hell-bent to leave. His mother’s quiet,
                                    crooked, apologetic smile. Her hopeless helplessness in
                                    the kitchen. The best years of her life, from age twenty to
                                    forty, had been celibate, and aside from the consummation
                                    that began his own life, the rest of her life had been the
                                    same. He hadn’t thought much of it when she’d told him, but
                                    now it seemed to him that such sexual deprivation would
                                    affect her, hurt her in precisely the way it would affect and
                                    hurt him. If it were possible for somebody to force him to
                                    live that way, to tell him, “You may walk and live among
                                    women, you may even lust after them, but you will not make
                                    love for the next twenty years,” how would he feel? What
                                    would he do? Would he continue as he was? And suppose
                                    he were married and his wife refused him for fifteen years.
                                    His mother had been able to live through that by a long
                                    nursing of her son, some occasional visits to a graveyard.
                                    What might she have been like had her husband loved her?

                                            and
                                            used people to acquire more things. As the son of Macon
                                            Dead the first, he paid homage to his own father’s life and
                                            death by loving what that father had loved: property, good
                                            solid property, the bountifulness of life. <b>He loved these
                                                things to excess because he loved his father to excess.</b>
                                            Owning, building, acquiring–that was his life, his future, his
                                            present, and all the history he knew. That he distorted life,
                                            bent it, for the sake of gain, was a measure of his loss at
                                            his father’s death.</mark></div>

                                <p>The work centers on Milkman and his transformation from a dissatisfied youth with
                                    little understanding
                                    about the larger world and the past that make people are what they are in the

                                    has gone out, experienced things for himself, and comes back completely changed in
                                    his mindset.
                                    It is the prototypical hero's journey, and Milkman's relationship with his father is
