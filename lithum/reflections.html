                <p>Throughout these works, the motif of the parent/child relationship takes roughly three forms. First,
                    there is the strong desire for the child's approval by the parent. In the case of father/son
                    relationship, the father is not malicious but merely derelict in his
                    paternal duties owing to his own absorption in the self. The son is left on the outside looking in,
                    wishing to be part of
                    the paternal lineage, looking for guidance, but cannot find it and so becomes resentful of the
                    father. In <i>To the Lighthouse</i>,
                    we see this in the figure of James and Mr. Ramsay.</p>
                <p>The second form is an aversion of the child toward the parent, a cosnciousness on the part of the
                    child of the parent's limitations and
                    a rejection of the parent on account of such. The parent becomes a burden and source of shame to the
                    child, who has attained a greater
                    level of insight than the parent and no longer sees herself on the same plane as the parent. The
                    child has no moral or existential crisis about
                    this and there is no impetus to separate oneself, so the only available option is to tolerate the
                    parent.
                    This would be the figure of Elizabeth in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> and her relationship with her
                    mother.</p>
                <p>The last form this relationship takes is a combination of the former two. There is at some point in
                    the relationship a great reverence
                    that is not reciprocated as well as later a great shame as the child becomes aware of the parent's
                    limitations. Perhaps owing to this
                    conflict in atttudes, the child is set on a path toward separation from the parent to try to gain a
                    better understanding of the self
                    before ultimately returning home. This would be Milkman and Macon Jr. in <i>Song of Solomon.</i></p>
                <p>A pattern I noticed throughout all of these works in passing them through the lens of this motif was
                    that the parent always
                    seems to have a domineering or overbearing presence for the child. In <i>To the Lighthouse</i>, Mr.
                    Ramsay is an imposing figure,
                    studiously and quietly studying his books, with an air of importance, dignity, and a readiness to be
                    overly critical of his son.
                    He is described by James in no uncertain terms as a "tyrant," noting the importance of resisting
                    "tyranny." Mrs. Bennet in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>
                    in her obstinance and meddling in the affairs of Elizabeth despite her vehement protestation is
                    likewise tyrannical in her own particular way.
                    Macon Jr. makes no pretenses about his tyranny, knows he is the head of his household, seeing
                    Milkman as his possession, and only when that
                    tyranny is challenged physically does it dawn on him that he has lost his power over his son.</p>
