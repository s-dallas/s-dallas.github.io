                        flashed, and I couldn't<br>

                        tell what it was<br>

                        that split the night</i></p>


                <p>"She smiled:" The use of the smile as an indicator of love seems a risky choice. There are many
                    possible
                    states or events that can induce a smile--as a sign of love or deeply felt emotions for another
                    person,
                    it seems to me a very weak indicator. The smile is too ubiquitous, too prone to overvaluation. As a
                    way
                    of visualizing the metaphors which follow this phrase, it is, however, rather appropriate: The smile
                    is
                    transitory--it comes on unbidden, without effort, and disappears just as readily.</p>

                <p>"Lightning flashed:" The analog of lightning for the beloved's smile suggests an instantaneous change
                    in
                    the lover's mindset rather than a gradually evolving romantic infatuation. It is a very appealing
                    image,
                    offering the potential for a radical change of state that might alter one's life course dramatically
                    in
                    a matter of seconds. It also suggests transience, a bright flash illuminating the sky for only a
                    brief
                    moment before returning the lover into a state of darkness. This might perhaps be akin to the
                    fickleness
                    of the beloved's attitude toward the lover, the attraction she feels being only momentary, to be
                    replaced just as quickly with dislike or indifference. In this case, the lightning is a fire that
                    produces light but no warmth. It might provide some insight to the lover or break him out of an
                    emotional stupor, but it may not necessarily portend what he thinks it does. This transience can
                    also
                    said to be in line with the idea of a continual renewal of the image and the impossibility of its
                    possession (Sells xxvii).</p>

                <p>"I couldn't tell:" This concerns the notion of uncertainty inherent to love--uncertainty as to where
                    one
                    stands with the beloved, uncertainty about the emotions stirring within the lover's and the
                    beloved's
                    hearts, uncertainty about who one is or would or could be if he were to merge with the beloved.
                    Here,
                    the lover is uncertain about the particular quality in the beloved's smile that gives it its
                    transformative power. The intention behind the smile appears to be hidden from the lover, though its
                    effect on him is very much in full view. I find parallels here with the "Bewildered" poem where the
                    lover is similarly in a state of uncertainty.</p>

                <p>"That split the night:" The night here is a metaphor for the lover's spiritual or emotional
                    barrenness.
                    It recalled for me the notion of the "dark night of the soul" from Christian mysticism, the idea of
                    a
                    spiritual crisis or difficult period in one's life that must be overcome. Stripped of its religious
                    overtones, love here stands in as the purifying or clarifying force that will set the lover's soul
                    at
                    ease and provide a path forward. The verb "split" here, as with the verb "flashed" which preceded
                    it,
                    suggests this is to be an instantaneous process rather than gradual, a sudden casting off of old
                    modes
                    of thinking, a tear in the fabric of the existential dilemma that plagues the lover. This would
                    perhaps
                    represent the death of the ego, or fana as Sells describes it in the introduction (xxvii).</p>


                <p class="ml-5 poem poem-sm poem-md poem-lg vertical-bar"><i>I live on and<br>

                        in living die<br>

                        Farewell to her, then,<br>

                        and to patience, farewell</i></p>


                <p>"I live on:" It is difficult to say what the lover's meaning is in this line. He appears conflicted
                    about the fact that he has endured the loss of his beloved. He lives on--is it a statement of fact,
                    of
                    regret? The following line suggests the latter, but it might also be read as a sign of great
                    resilience.</p>

                <p>"In living die:" The pairing of antonyms here ("live" and "die") is intentional and meant to convey
                    that
                    life is both physically and metaphorically a process of death. Physical in the sense that all human
                    bodies from the moment of birth are in a state of continual decay which has its endpoint fixed at a
                    certain hour on a certain day in a certain season. Metaphorical in the sense that for some, the
                    process
                    of living, and dealing with the indignities and pains that life brings with it, is its own form of
                    death. I am reminded here of Hamlet's well-known soliloquy:</p>

                <p class="ml-5 poem poem-sm poem-md poem-lg vertical-bar"><i>To die, to sleep<br>

                        No more; and by a sleep, to say we end<br>

                        The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks<br>

                        That Flesh is heir to?<br>

                        ...<br>

                        For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,<br>

                        The Oppressor's wrong, the proud man's Contumely,<br>

                        The pangs of dispriz'd Love, the Law’s delay,<br>

                        The insolence of Office, and the spurns<br>

                        That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,<br>

                        When he himself might his Quietus make<br>

                        With a bare Bodkin?</i></p>


                <p>"Farewell to her, then:" This conveys that the lover no longer has access to the beloved, but the way
                    it
                    is delivered suggests a sort of defiance on the part of the lover. He cannot have her, so farewell,
                    sent
                    on her way with a rude gesture by which the lover hopes to cauterize his wounds. It is noteworthy in
                    its
                    apparent simplicity: Farewell! I wash my hands of thee. That is all. But the reader knows that is
                    not
                    all. The beloved will return in images to haunt him. The expression is traditionally used for an
                    amicable parting ("I hope that you fare well"), but it is not likely that the lover's parting was
                    either
                    amicable or willed, nor that her rejection of him has not spawned a great deal of animosity.</p>

                <p>"To patience, farewell:" To love is to become awash in time. The pleasure the beloved brings does
                    away
                    with notions of time. The loved man is too concerned with securing and enjoying his possession, too
                    immersed in the gentleness of her embrace, to allow restlessness any room within his soul. With her
                    loss, so the loss of patience. But the line here suggests more than this: It is also a hardening of
                    the
                    lover's soul, a statement of future unwillingness to invest himself in another again only to endure
                    further heartbreak.</p>


                <p class="ml-5 poem poem-sm poem-md poem-lg vertical-bar"><i>She casts you the gaze<br>

                        of a fawn gazelle<br>

                        a glint of obsidian<br>

                        in her eyes</i></p>


                <p>"Gaze:" A gaze can be thought of as anodyne, particularly when coming from a lover, but it might also
                    have an element of danger in it. The context here with the gaze being "cast" suggests something
                    sinister
                    or alchemical. Upon first reading, I thought of Medusa and her petrifying gaze. Medusa was
                    originally
                    conceived as a beautiful woman turned ugly by Neptune, who gave her a coiffure of serpents. This
                    juxtaposition of beauty and vileness is something of a cynical take on femininity. The imagery
                    conjured
                    might be said to be that of an aggressive seductress, though this notion is immediately dispensed
                    with
                    in the line that follows.</p>

                <p>"Fawn gazelle:" The gazelle seems to be a motif in many of these poems. The fawn is innocence
                    incarnate:
                    Wide-eyed, vigilant, vulnerabale, in need of protection. The gaze referenced earlier then has been
                    transmuted from stone back into flesh, a sort of Daphne and Apollo in reverse. The gaze of innocence
                    entices the lover, triggering his instinct to nurture and protect.</p>

                <p>"Glint:" A glint is a momentary flash of light. It might reference the glittering eyes of a lover in
                    an
                    amorous reverie, but there is no sense of continuity in the term. A glint is more akin to a spark,
                    something temporary and sharp, like the glint of a steel blade. The image it conjures is a quick
                    burst
                    of violent energy that can only be seen from certain angles or in certain contexts, a metaphor for
                    the
                    hidden or unseen aspect of love that carries with it the potential for great pain.</p>

                <p>"Obsidian:" The choice of obsidian to describe the beloved's eyes alludes to the gaze in the first
                    line.
                    We are back in the realm of stone, now the hard, black obsidian. Stone not only suggests a quality
                    of
                    impenetrability and frigidity, but the blackness of obsidian also calls to mind demonic imagery: a
                    creature with solid-black eyes, an unnatural, unearthly and malevolant being.</p>

                <p>The poet in this stanza appears to be confusing the reader's sense of perception. The rapid
                    oscillation
                    between innocence and its opposite is a way of showing the dual nature of love. The idea here is
                    that
                    pleasure and pain are intertwined, inextricably so. One cannot have love without sorrow, innocence
                    without conniving, warmth without the looming threat of the ice storm. It is this duality which
                    gives
                    love its potency and amplifies the lover's sense of longing.</p>
